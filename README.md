# The Epic of that Guy Named George
![George.png](Images/George.png)

A game of grand adventure and hilarity.

It was in ancient times, when plot was greatly lacking, that the guy named George - no, *that* guy named George, set off on a grand adventure to follow in the footsteps of his great ancestor Stickman Steve, whom he had learned about through the great tales heard in the [Library of Epics](https://nathanscheck.com/projects) (as told by the reader of ancient texts, [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs)).

However, adventure was not what it seemed to be, for there was a great evil coming upon the land: the evil ruler of Kvar Zakara was sending his deadly creatures out to roam the fine fields of the Firoth, where *that* George dwelt. These creatures were dark and monstrous, capable of destroying the pleasant pastures of the good farmers of the land.

Adventure is found on the very fields by George's home, but can he survive them? There is a command that all battle-able people should go to the nearest castle to train and preparte for the dark adventure. How many will be able to get there?
